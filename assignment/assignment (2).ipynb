    "1. What makes a model \"linear\"? \"Linear\" in what?\n",
    "2. How do you interpret the coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable? (This is a trick question, and the trick involves how you handle the intercept of the model.)\n",
    "3. Can linear regression be used for classification? Explain why, or why not.\n",
    "4. What are signs that your linear model is over-fitting?\n",
    "5. Clearly explain multi-colinearity using the two-stage least squares technique.\n",
    "6. How can you incorporate nonlinear relationships between your target/response/dependent/outcome variable $y$ and your features/control/response/independent variables $x$ into your analysis?\n",
    "7. What is the interpretation of the intercept? A slope coefficient for a variable? The coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable?"

    "#### Answer ####\n",
    "1. A model is made linear by its weights. If the model takes on this form y=w⊤x+b regardless of the form the input is in, it's linear. It needs to be linear in w and b, the intercept. Even if x is raised to a power other than one, a model can be lienar.\n",
    "2. The coefficient means different things depending on how the intercepts/dummy variables were handled. If one wants to know the value associated exactly with each of the variables, one should drop the intercept column. If one wants to know the coefficient value in relation to a baseline category, one should keep the intercept and drop the variable. If the first method is used, the coefficient is the value directly associated with the variable it is being multiplied by, otherwise it's the difference of the variable in the associated category versus the one dropped.\n",
    "3. Yes, it can be used. The linear model is actually a very refined way of classifying outcomes because it weighs specific explanatory variables.\n",
    "4. A sign that the linear model is over-fitting is when it's using too many explanatory variables. This could be a sign that it's using unrelated cases to predict outcomes. This would result in little error in the training data, and a large test error.\n",
    "5. Multi-colinearity refers to high correlation between two explanatory variables. This can create unstable estimates and lack of differentiation between variables. Taking an instrumental variable, or a variable that is known not to be correlated with the error term, then predicting the values of the problematic variable by regressing them on the IV, and then using these X^ (hats) to regress the ultimate variable on interest on the cleaned explanatory variables reduces this messy interdependence that we know as multi-colinearity.\n",
    "6. Non-linear coefficients can simply be denoted by a letter term (that represents something non-linear). The model can be made linear even though the underlying relationships are transformed in some non-linear manner.\n",
    "7. The intercept is the expected value of the variable we are predicting when the weights of the explanatory variables are 0. It's a baseline before any explanatory variables take effect. A slope coefficients explains change in the value we are predicting when there is a 1 unit increase in x (of the specific explanatory variable). In linear regression, this is the weight. The coefficient for dummy variables means different things depending on how the multi-colinearity is handled, but we interpret it as either the direct value/weight, or the different in relation to the weight of the category dropped- the baseline)"

Compare the coefficients in the regression to the table from part 1. What pattern do you see? What are the coefficients in a regression of a continuous variable on one categorical variable?\n",

Split the sample 80/20 into a training and a test set and run a regression including that kind of \"property type X neighborhood\" dummy, plus `Review Scores Rating`. How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5? Are the coefficients in this regression just the sum of the coefficients for `Neighbourhood ` and `Property Type` from 5? What is the most expensive kind of property you can rent?"

    "2. The table of averages is exactly the same as the coefficients that we calculated by regressing price on neighbourhood (dummy data). This makes sense since the linear model is predicting one coefficient per neighbourhood- since we have no intercept and don't need to drop a neighbourhood to create a refence. Naturally, the best value for this relationship will be the average price of housing in each neighbourhood. Regressing a continuous value on a categorical one, will therefore yield coefficients that are the averages of y- the continuous category (grouped by categorial variable)."

    "3. When including an intercept, a category must be dropped during the creation of dummy variables. We did this by including the argument drop_first=True. This dropped the Bronx and thus our intercept became the value of the average house in the Bronx, intercept = 75.2764977. These coefficients are the differences between one neighbourhood's average price and the average price of the Bronx. The coefficients from part 2 can be retrieved by adding the intercept to each of these coefficients (since they are differences). This second method allows us to see average prices relative to one category, and can be helpful in this respect."

After the introduction of property type, it is possible that the relationship between Review Score Rating and price becomes weaker. This can be true because of multi-colinearity in action. It would make that sense that Review Score Rating would have some correlation with property type. Typically, larger, more luxurious properties would received higher ratings.

We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones?

    "#### Answer ####\n",
    "1. b* will be large when covariance between X and Y (which is essentially the numerator) is large. This means that the X and Y variables are highly correlated with each other. If they both increase together, this relationship will be strong and positive leading to a large slope. At the same time, if they correlate negatively (go in opposite directions, but strongly related), we will have a large but negative slope. b* will be small when the variance of x (or the denominator is large) or the covariance between X and Y is small. Low level of variance in X means the values are concentrated around the mean.\n",
    "2. The intercept of a model can be affected. The equation for intercept is technically a* = ybar-b* xbar. The b* coefficient shrinks because of all of the noise around X (the denominator in the equation invcreases), and then the intercept a* shifts up accordingly. In a noiseless model, the variance would be lower, and thus the b* coefficient will be higher. This affects the weights, and makes the explanatory variable that b* is associated with weigh less in the model. This leads to underfitting.\n",
    "3. Despite the fact that the noise is just measurement error or lazy data, it still has the ability to affect our model. This is because it affects the slopes that are calculated for each variable, even if this is independently, without pattern. The random noise can cause more variance and make the prediction of the relationship between X an Y worse. The increase in variance will decrease b* and underestimate the weight of explanatory variables in the model. It's important to note that this noise is not systematic, it doesn't follow a pattern, but is due to random human error. As a result, it'll preserve the overall relationship, just not quite accurately capture it's weight.\n",
    "4. Attenuation can impact the precision of the estimate of the relationship between two variables. In general, the relationships are maintained, evven with this noise. This is where the trade offs come in. If the specifics and precise weights associated with explanatory variables are important, it may be well worth it to gather high quality data or clean it more carefully. Of course these things take time and resources, which may not be worth using if the specifics of the model are not that important. If someone wants a general idea of what is going on, and isn't looking closely at b* or intercepts, then it isn't worth the cost to avoid attenuation sometimes."
